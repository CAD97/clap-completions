addr2line 0.1
A fast addr2line Rust port

USAGE:
    addr2line [OPTIONS] --exe <filename> [addrs]...

ARGS:
    <addrs>...    Addresses to use instead of reading from stdin.

OPTIONS:
    -a, --addresses         Display the address before the function name, file and line number
                            information.
    -C, --demangle          Demangle function names. Specifying a specific demangling style (like
                            GNU addr2line) is not supported. (TODO)
    -e, --exe <filename>    Specify the name of the executable for which addresses should be
                            translated.
    -f, --functions         Display function names as well as file and line number information.
    -h, --help              Print help information
    -i, --inlines           If the address belongs to a function that was inlined, the source
                            information for all enclosing scopes back to the first non-inlined
                            function will also be printed.
        --llvm              Display output in the same format as llvm-symbolizer.
    -p, --pretty-print      Make the output more human friendly: each location are printed on one
                            line.
    -s, --basenames         Display only the base of each file name.
        --sup <filename>    Path to supplementary object file.
    -V, --version           Print version information
